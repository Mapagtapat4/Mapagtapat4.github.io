<h1>My Extended Definition Essay On Relational Chemistry</h1>
<center><h2>Relational Chemistry</h2></center>
<center><p>In the romantic anime film "Kimi no Na wa" or "Your Name", the emotional connection 
between protagonists Tachibana Taki and Miyazumi Mitsuha was the key factor for saving thousands of 
lives from a meteorite crash despite both of them living from different dimensions and timelines. Their 
emotional connection or relational chemistry was caused by their romantic love for one another. 
Relational chemistry is an emotional connection between two people; relational chemistry is different 
from conceptual alignment; relational chemistry is caused by the common goals and affiliations of 
individuals.</p>
<p>             Relational chemistry is the emotional connection between individuals. It can be 
observed by either instant or gradual achievement of compatibility (Campbell, 2015). The instant 
emotional connection between individuals is based on their first impressions of one another. First
 impression is the initial view of individuals towards one another on their first interaction. In the few
 seconds of interaction, accurate and detailed impressions of one another are recorded in one's memory
 (Rholetter, 2017). If both individuals see good impressions from one another then, it's possible that they
 achieve compatibility and eventually be comfortable with one another and that causes a relationship to
 flourish in a short span of time. On the other hand, the gradual establishment of emotional connection
 between individuals can be achieved with continuous interaction of individuals. This is when individuals
 fail to achieve compatibility on their first encounter because of the inaccurate interpretation of the initial
 impressions both parties gave off. Establishment of emotional connection may still be possible through
 continuous interaction of individuals and furthermore make the relationship flourish in a longer span of
 time.</p>
<p>
                  Relational chemistry is different from conceptual alignment. Conceptual alignment refers to 
the common computational procedures the minds of two individuals undergo (Stolk, Verhagen, & Toni, 
2016), but it is also a factor that can greatly contribute to the relational chemistry of two individuals. 
Relational chemistry and conceptual alignment can be differentiated using two criteria. The first 
criterion is the involvement of interaction. Relational chemistry is based solely on the interaction of 
individuals while conceptual alignment is an analysis based on the gathered data from each individual 
which requires no interaction. The second criterion is intensity. In relational chemistry, it is the strength 
of the relationship of individuals that determines their compatibility. Meanwhile, in conceptual 
alignment, it is the common way of thinking that determines the compatibility of individuals.</p>
<p>Relational chemistry is caused by the similarities of individuals in their goals, and 
affiliations. The established relationship of individuals may be the result of the similarities in their 
backgrounds and affiliations. For instance, being classmates in high school, childhood friends, neighbors, 
having the same line of work, or co-workers.  It can be also resulted by the similarity of goals and 
interests of individuals. For example, similarity of taste in the fields of music, sports, food, literature, and 
in other many fields. It goes the same for having common goals in life (Pinsky, 2011). With these 
commonalities, the individuals will tend to have meaningful and frequent interactions because they 
have someone to share their ideas with who has similar ideas as them. This results to the establishment
 of emotional connection between the individuals.</p>
<p>                     Relational chemistry is the attachment of individuals to one another, and it can be attained
 instantly or through time; relational chemistry can be differentiated from conceptual alignment in 
terms of interaction and intensity of compatibility; relational chemistry dwells on the similarities of the
 mindsets and backgrounds of individuals that causes frequent and relevant interactions that supports
 the emotional connection between the individuals. </p></center>
