<h1>My Kundirana Experience</h1>

<h3>Auditions</h3>
<p>Before considering auditioning for the Kundirana music ministry 
of La Salle Green Hills, I was very hesitant because I thought my skill
set would fall short of the required skill set to be the drummer of the group.
But then I thought that I won't really lose anything if I try. </p>
<p>I did not really do a lot of preparations for the auditions. I was just
jamming to the songs that I usually jam to. Day of the auditions, I was a bit
late because of some conflict with schedule. We were 6 drummers that auditioned
for that one precious spot. They were all skilled and had the right confidence 
for the spot. My pieces were also decent but in the end, I was placed as second pick, 
in short, I failad (hahahuhu).</p>
<p>A month after, the drummer who got accepted quit and so I was called out and was 
asked if I was still interested in the spot. I said yes so I got in</p>

<h3>Rehearsals</h3>

<p>The batch, in generel, but especially me, had a hard time completing the reportoire
because the pieces were hard and we had people leaving the group. But the remaining people
in the group's drives were strong enough to accomplish what had to be done. So we survived
and managed to play our concerts</p>

<h3>Gigs and Shows</h3>

<p>Gigging and performing in front of many people may give you wild moths in your stomach but
that feeling will be different if you're performing out of charity. Helping people, and inspiring 
them are just  few reasons why we have a strong drive and try to perfect our craft. We also had gigs
outside the country. The Kundirana music ministry of LSGH has a partnership with FACOSD. We did some
reach outs and charity concerts in North and South San Diego, Inland Empire, Temecula, and Las Vegas.
Genrally, it was really life-changing. It moved me to find the sweetest of smile in every person I encounter
who are buzzed with problems and in need of a helping hand.</p>

<p>My senior year in Kundirana, meaning my last year as part of the music ministry.
I have grown a lot after my first term as a Kundirana member. We generally had the same
experience as last year but for this year, we had no USA tour becasue of some complications.
Despite that matter, it was definately a year well lived.</p>
