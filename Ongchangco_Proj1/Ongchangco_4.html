<h1>The Top 5  Necessities You Need To Survive A Day in College</h1>
<ol type = disk>
<li><h2>I.D.</h2></li>
<p>Your identification card is the most important thing you need
because you would not be able to enter the school without it. The 
guards wont let you in. And if ever you try to secure a pass, it will
be recorded and an accumulation of a forgoten I.D. will lead to a 
sanction and will further affect your clearance. You wont be able to 
move on to the next term that smoothly.</p>

<li><h2>Ballpen</h2></li>
<p>The next most important thing you need to have with you to be able 
to survive a day in college is a ballpen. You use your ballpen for almost
everything and anything. If you don't have anything with you to write any
necessary information, to write for your exams, seatworks, quizzes,etc.,
you definately won't be able to survive because all of your necessary
documents would be blank just because you had nothing to write with. That's
one reason why you need to bring a pen. Another significant use of a pen, for
me, is for opening stuff. For example, you have a bag of chips that you're
having a hard time opening. You don't have a pair of scissors, or a swiss army knife
with you. The only thing you could use is your handy dandy pen that you can use to 
pierce through the packaging of the bag of chips. </p>

<li><h2>Bag</h2></li>
<p>The third most important thing to bring to survive a day in college is
your bag. Without your bag, you wont be able to efficiently move around the
campus especially whenever it is necessary for you to rush like in an instance
if you are running late to a class where you have a quiz on. Of course you wouldn't
want your stuff to be flying around the campus and kneeling every 3 seconds just to
pick up your belongings that fell. Also, with your bag, you'd be able to multitask and
accomplish different tasks simuntaneously because both of your hands are free. For example,
you're helping your crush/bf/gf with his/her stuff. That's basically it, you use a bag to 
carry your stuff around efficiently.</p>

<li><h2>Umbrella</h2></li>
<p>The fourth most important thing to bring to be able to survive a day in college is your
umbrella. Without your umbrella, all of your stuff would probably wet right now. Especially
if you're a commuter, having an umbrella with you is a complete must. Let's say you're walking
to the next terminal that doesn't have a roof to protect you from the rain. You're crossing from
one terminal to another and then rain poured down hard. All those notes and other school stuff 
you have with you will be wet and be of no use anyore. So it is important for you to actually 
have something with you to protect you from the rain. And that thing you go to should be an umbrella.
Not only an umbrella can protect you from the rain, but also it can be a tool for self-defense.</p>

<li><h2>Phone</h2></li>
<p>The final thing to bring in my list of what to bring to school to be able to survive a day in
college is a phone, more specifically, a smartphone. With a smart phone, you can be able to do a 
lot of things in the palm of your hand. There are hundreds of usefull tools you can use there like 
whenever you get lost, there's a mobile GPS within arms reach. Whenever you have to add or subtract 
something, there's a built in calcuator in your phone. Whenever you need to contact someone 
for org work like the signing of papers, you can easily leave your org-mates a message using a numerous
number of social media applications or via SMS. We are given of this privelege and we should maximize it's
wide range of uses.</p>
