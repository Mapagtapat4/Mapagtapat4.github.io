<body><H1> The School Life of M.N.O. 4</H1>

<p>Henlo everyone! In this html, I will be sharing with you guys
how my school-life is so far. It can be a bit boring, a bit thrilling,
a bit of everything. So stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Pre-school dayz...</h2>

<p>Back in my pre-schooling days, I lived in Bulacan and 
basically spent my childhood there. Yes, I was a probinsyano
like Cardo Dalisay with only half of his action skillz.
I loved running around our property with some cats and dogs that
I play with, I was a really huge fan of bathing in the rain, I used
to go hunting, catching, and ripping the wings off of every dragonfly
that I see. Yes, I was really physically active and maharot. I went
to Sta. Phelomena in Bulacan for pre-school, I really can't remember 
anything about that place anymore exept for that one time I was made
to wear a hawaiian outfit and dance this hawaiian dance of sort. It made 
me really sad because I didn't like that flower thingy on my neck because
it made my neck itch a lot.</p>

<h2>Kinder dayz......</h2>

<p>In kinder, it doesn't seem like it but.. I was an achiever.
In Kinder 1, I was really this maharot kid that brings toys to school. 
There was this one time that I tried to sneak a water gun in school and 
got easily boomed by the teacher :'(. But aside all that, I WAS an 
achiever. During the recognition day, I got a silver medal. With that
achievement, I skipped grade 2 and went straight to advanced casa. During
advanced casa, I got in an accident. I was running and then I tripped on the
wire of a fan. I fell head first and I was hospitalized. I was okay but then
after that phase, I got lessfocused on my academics. I got my harotness a notch 
higher.  </p>

<h2>Gradeschool dayz.........</h2>

<p>Oh I fogrot to mention, but when I started kinder, we already moved in
in our newly made house in Taguig City in 2006. (P.S. Yes I spend my 6 years in
a province). So I went to this school near my place called 'Integrated Montessori
 Center'. I spent my whole kinder and grade school there. From grades 1-4, I was enrolled 
in the P.M. classes. I was really unprodoctive and I tend to focus less on studies. On the 
other hand, when I was enrolled in the A.M. classes from my 5th to 6th grade, I was really
productive and I even got to be a Merit Awardee. I graduated my grade school in thr same school. </p>

<h2>Highschool dayz............</h2>

<p>I started my highschool as a grade 9 student in La Salle Green Hills (GH GAAA). I started my first
2 years in LSGH adjusting and familiarizing with the school and the people in it. Even though it was
an adjusting phase, I managed to make it fun with my small circle of friends. Came third year, I started 
being very active. I joined this community called search-in met a lot of people who eventually became my
brothers in Christ. Also, I became part of 'Kundirana' -- La Salle Green Hills' music ministry where the 
likes of Gary Valencio, Ogie Alcasid, Randy Santiago, etc., got discovered. My stay in Kundirana was fun
-filled, full of love, and rewards out of the hard work we invested on our repertoires. I wasn't only
active in co and extra curricular activities, but I also tried to cope up with my academics. I was almost
consistent third honors  and consistent deportment awardee during my stay. I graduated highschool on March
2017. </p>
